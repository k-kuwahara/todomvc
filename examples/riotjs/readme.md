# Riot.js TodoMVC Example

> Simple and elegant component-based UI library

> Riot is against the current trend of boilerplate and unneeded complexity. The team think that a small, powerful API and concise syntax are extremely important things on a client-side library.

## Implementation

Riot is tiny and super flexible, there are many different ways to use riot. For example, you can use compiler to compile the tags files, you can also use browserify to build bundled javascript, you can even use the tiny Riot compiler on your page and compile tags on the fly.

This example is using compiler on the page to compile the tag file (`js/todo.html`).

This example is following TodoMVC's [coding style](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/codestyle.md), however officially Riot recommends a [different coding style](https://github.com/riot/riot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), FYI.
